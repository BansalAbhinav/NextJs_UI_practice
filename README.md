Next.js UI Integration Practice
===============================

This project is a personal practice repository where I explored and implemented various UI components and patterns using **Next.js**. The main goal was to get hands-on experience with modern UI techniques and improve my understanding of building beautiful, interactive web applications.

About the Project
-----------------

*   **Framework:** Next.js
    
*   **Focus:** UI integration and component design
    
*   **Purpose:** Self-learning and experimentation
    

I followed along with tutorials and resources to deepen my knowledge, especially focusing on the UI aspects of Next.js. This project is not meant for production, but serves as a playground to try out new ideas and solidify my understanding.

Getting Started
